		<p>Chess is a board game played between two players that is played all around the world by Millions of people. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the late 1500s after evolving from a similar even older game from India called chaturanga. Chess is officially an "abstract strategy game" and is even considered a "Mind sport". However unlike many other strategy games, chess involves no hidden information. Both players have the same information right in front of them, it is entirely up to them on what to do with it.</p>

		<p>Chess is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
